# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM , Bidirectional

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. The predictive models are built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and bidirectional LSTM for enhanced performance. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using and mean absolute error.
## Data Collection
The data is collected from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves exploring and understanding the structure of the data, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into the stock price trends.
## Data Preprocessing
Handling missing data and removing duplicates to ensure a clean dataset.
## Feature Engineering
Utilizing min-max scaling for feature scaling to normalize the input data for better model performance.
## Model Building
LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM models are implemented for stock price prediction.
## Model Evaluation
Evaluation is performed using Mean Absolute Error metrics.
